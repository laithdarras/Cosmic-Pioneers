# ‚òÑÔ∏è Zero-G Knockout - an Exercise Rhythm Game for Astronauts

Prolonged exposure to zero gravity in space can have significant effects on the human body. Without the constant pull of gravity, muscles and bones weaken due to decreased use, leading to muscle atrophy and bone density loss. The cardiovascular system also experiences changes, with blood and fluids redistributing, often causing facial puffiness and decreased blood volume in the legs. Zero-G Knockout is an exercise app using personalized biometrics data to create the optimal cardiovascular exercise regime. Our app takes into account the fitness needs of astronauts all while addressing the unique challenges of living in a space station.

## ‚ÑπÔ∏è Project Details

Our project consists of two main components: a meta app which combines the user's biometrics data and fitness requirements to construct the optimal playlist and an augmented reality (AR) game designed to help astronauts exercise within space.

Using ReactJS, we build a mock-up of the meta app in which a user representing an astronaut can enter information regarding their desired workout routine. Combining the user's biometrics data taken from routine medical check-ups, the meta app constructs a playlist for the exercise routine with a targeted, average beats-per-minute (bpm). In principle, the meta app uses the targeted, average bpm to help users reach a desired elevated heart rate.
